OR Use terminal, cd into CodeTest.DepthChart.Console folder and execute 'dotnet run' command.
* Sports.json has position config for NFL and MLB, To add more sports this file can be update with additional mappings

# Run tests
* CodeTest.DepthChart.Tests has some tests (integration tests), these tests and validate the functionality.
